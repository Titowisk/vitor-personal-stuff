# Mitigation techniques

## Provide meaningful information
By providing meaningful information, the logs can help detect, diagnose, and respond to security incidents, as well as support compliance requirements. At a minimum, they should include answers to:

- When did the event happen?

Include a timestamp in the log entries.

- Where did the event happen?

Include an application/component identifier to help locate where the event happened.

- Who performed the action?

Include an identifier of the entity performing the action (user, service, ...).

- What happened?

Include the type of the event (authentication failure, successful authentication, ...).
Include the severity of the event (debug, info, warning, ...). This describes how important or critical is the event.
Include a description with additional details.

**Logging full stack traces** can be useful for troubleshooting and debugging, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind when developing a logging strategy:

- Full stack traces can be very large and can quickly consume a significant amount of storage space. As a result, it may be more practical to log only a subset of the stack trace or to limit the number of full stack traces that are logged.

- Full stack traces can contain sensitive information, such as file paths and function names, that could be exploited by attackers. As a result, it is important to consider whether the potential benefits of logging full stack traces outweigh the security risks.

- Logging full stack traces can clutter up log files, making it more difficult to locate and analyze specific log events. This can be mitigated by logging full stack traces only when necessary (such as during troubleshooting or debugging), and using a different log destination (file, database, ...).


## Generate log records for key events
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of what events to log in an application, as the specific events to be logged will depend on the nature and purpose of the application. However, some general recommendations for which events to log in an application are:

Any events that relate to security, such as user authentication, authorization, and access control. This includes successful and unsuccessful login attempts, user permissions changes, and any actions that could potentially compromise security.

Any events that are critical to the functioning of the business, such as payment transactions, order processing, and customer account updates.

Any events that indicate an error or exception has occurred, such as system exceptions, unhandled and handled errors, and application crashes.

## Use an appropriate log destination
The recommended log destinations for application logging depend on the needs and requirements of the organization and its applications. However, some common log destinations for application logging include:

### Local storage: 
logs can be stored locally on the same machine as the application, either in a file or a database. This is a simple and straightforward option, but it may not be suitable for larger or distributed systems as there are a few caveats. One of them would be the lack of visibility and monitoring. Another one would be the consideration of disk space and log rotation because log files can quickly consume a large amount of space on a server. Log files can become outdated and take up unnecessary space and excessive logging can also cause performance issues. By implementing log rotation, you can ensure that your log files do not grow indefinitely, freeing up space for new logs, and potentially improve performance by spreading out the logging activity over multiple files. Overall, it is important to implement a log rotation strategy that balances the need for log data with the need to conserve disk space, prevent performance issues, and address security concerns.

### Remote storage: 
logs can be stored on a remote server or in a centralized logging system, such as a log server or log management tool. This allows for easy access to log data from multiple systems and can make it easier to centralize log analysis and reporting.

Additionally, and depending on the execution environment, the application can simply send the log events to the stdout. The execution environment will be responsible for collecting the logs and sending them to an appropriate location (like a centralized log collection and management system). Some examples for these execution environments would be:

In containerized environments, such as Docker, the logs generated by applications running in containers can be collected and managed using a centralized log collection and management system like Fluentd or Logstash.
In Unix-like systems, the logs can be redirected to the syslog service, which provides a centralized logging mechanism for all applications. The syslog service can be configured to rotate logs, compress old logs, and store them in a specific location.
In cloud environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the logs generated by applications running on virtual machines can be collected and managed using a centralized log collection and management system like Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Google Stackdriver Logging.
The choice of log destination will depend on the scale and complexity of the application and the organization's requirements for log storage, analysis, and reporting. When possible, it is recommended to use a combination of log destinations to ensure that logs are stored in multiple locations for redundancy and to meet regulatory or compliance requirements.

## Avoid logging sensitive information
To ensure the protection of sensitive information, it is recommended that certain types of data should not be directly recorded in the logs. Instead, such data should be removed, masked, sanitized, hashed, or encrypted. Examples of data that should be treated in this way include:

Application source code.
Session identification values (which may be replaced with hashed values for tracking purposes).
Credentials like access tokens, authentication passwords, database connection strings, etc.
Encryption keys.
Personally identifiable information (PII) like name, medical records, social security number, etc.
Payment card holder information.
In addition, commercially-sensitive information, information that is illegal to collect, and information that a user has opted out of collecting or not consented to should also be treated in the same manner.

## Implement proactive log monitoring for better security
Implement a proactive monitoring system that can detect and alert on anomalies or suspicious activities in the log data. This can include setting up alerts or triggers for specific events or patterns that indicate potential security breaches, such as repeated failed login attempts or unusual levels of user activity. Regularly reviewing and analyzing log data can also help to identify potential risks or vulnerabilities in the system, and enable prompt response and remediation.
