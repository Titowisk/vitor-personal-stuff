# Introduction
Logging in the context of containerization is pivotal for the operational health, monitoring, and security of applications. Efficiently managing logs is not just about troubleshooting but also about maintaining the integrity and security of systems in containerized environments. This is particularly crucial when using technologies and orchestration tools that enable the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

# Description
In containerized environments, logs serve as the eyes and ears of the infrastructure. Without appropriate logging mechanisms in place, detecting anomalies, tracing issues back to their origins, or even understanding the operational state of containers becomes challenging. These environments generate vast amounts of log data that can be invaluable for monitoring container health, tracking system performance, and identifying security threats. Missing or insufficient logging can leave blind spots, making it difficult to respond to operational incidents or security threats promptly. Best practices, such as centralized logging, retaining logs for adequate durations, and ensuring logs capture sufficient detail from both the container runtime and the application itself, are crucial. Adopting these practices ensures not only operational resilience but also bolsters security by providing visibility into the activities of every containerized component.

# Mitigation Techniques
Below are some generic mitigation techniques related to logging and monitoring in containerized environments:

Implement centralized logging
Centralize logs from all containers to a single location to simplify monitoring and analysis, using tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack) or Fluentd.

Retain logs adequately
Establish and adhere to a log retention policy, ensuring logs are stored securely for sufficient durations to meet operational and compliance needs.

Secure log data
Protect log data with encryption both in transit and at rest and implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.

Optimize log storage
Implement log rotation and compression strategies to optimize storage usage and manage the growing volume of log data efficiently.

# Kubernetes
Kubernetes has the capability to produce logs from multiple components at diverse levels. However, when these logs are inadequately captured, stored, or monitored, it paves the way for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities unnoticed. Moreover, insufficient logging hampers effective incident investigation and response.

Logging shortfalls arise when:

- Significant events like failed authentications, accessing sensitive resources, or manual edits to Kubernetes resources are not recorded.
- Active workload logs aren't scrutinized for unusual activities.
- No set alert thresholds or inadequate escalation.
- Logs are not protected from manipulation or stored centrally.
- Logging infrastructure is turned off.

To address these shortcomings, ensure the following logs are actively managed:

**Network Logs**: Captured at different layers within Kubernetes. For instance, if using proxies like nginx or apache, employ the stdout and stderr pattern for log capture. Projects like eBPF offer network and kernel logs for enhanced security visibility.

**Operating System Logs**: Depending on the OS of the Kubernetes nodes, logs like those from systemd might be available via commands such as journalctl -u.

**Cloud Provider Logs**: For those using managed environments like AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE, various logging streams are available. For instance, Amazon EKS offers logs for its Authenticator component, vital for security teams as it deals with RBAC authentication via AWS IAM credentials.

**Application & Container Logs**: [Logs generated within Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) are invaluable from a security perspective. Common practice is to write logs to stdout and stderr streams. These are often written to a log file, then forwarded by a sidecar container for centralized processing.

Finally, **Kubernetes Audit Logs** provide a detailed record of the sequence of activities that have transpired via the Kubernetes API server. These logs capture information about who did what, when, and to which resource. The logs are an essential resource for administrators to monitor, investigate, and trace activities or changes that have occurred in their Kubernetes clusters.

- Key points about Kubernetes audit logs:

    **Audit Policy**: Administrators define an audit policy that stipulates which events should be recorded and at which level. The policy can allow for fine-grained control, such as specifying different levels for different types of resources or namespaces.

    **Omit Stages**: it is a list of stages for which no events are created. This can also be specified per rule in which case the union of both are omitted. A misconfiguration in the omitStages field can prevent logs from being generated at specific stages. If you specify a stage in the omitStages field, audit events for that stage will not be generated, regardless of any other rule criteria that might otherwise apply to the request.

    The RequestReceived stage is often superfluous, so you can employ omitStages to exclude it. Although the RequestReceived stage notes the initial reception of the request by the API server, this detail is already recorded in the requestReceivedTimestamp attribute of your audit logs during the ResponseComplete stage.

    **Audit Levels**: Kubernetes audit logs can be configured to record logs at different levels:

        - None: Do not log events. You can use this level to ignore endpoints that donâ€™t capture relevant information but be cautious not to apply it to critical endpoints that require auditing.

        - Metadata: Log request metadata (e.g., who, when, what), but not request or response bodies.

        - Request: Log event metadata and request bodies but not the response. This provides more insight into what values or configurations were supplied during the request.

        - RequestResponse: Log event metadata, request, and response bodies. This provides the most comprehensive view but can also be the most verbose.

    > NOTE: Audit logs can contain sensitive data, especially if logging at the Request or RequestResponse levels. Before generating them, consider whether they actually need to be produced at all. If they are created, it's crucial to ensure they are stored securely and are only accessible to authorized individuals. Additionally, when integrating with external systems, ensure that logs are transmitted securely.

    **Audit Backends**: Once an event is processed according to the audit policy, it's handed off to the backend, which decides where the log is stored. Kubernetes supports two main backends:

        - Log Backend: Writes audit events to the local file system of the master node where the API server runs.
        - Webhook Backend: Sends audit events to an external HTTP API, which can be useful for integrating with external logging solutions or SIEM systems.
