Introduction
In the realm of containerized applications, network segmentation becomes even more paramount. Containers, by design, encapsulate applications in discrete environments, ensuring that they run consistently across various platforms. However, if proper network segmentation isn't implemented, a compromise in one container could potentially lead to unauthorized access or exposure in another. The microservices architecture, often employed with containers, further emphasizes the importance of this. Each microservice, while operating independently, communicates over the network, and insufficient segmentation could mean that sensitive information might leak, be tampered with, or even be exposed to unauthorized entities.

Description
With the advent of containerization, networking dynamics have experienced a profound change. If not properly configured, the network where containers operate might be devoid of segmented partitions and strict firewall rules. This can pave the way for a network setup where every microservice can communicate freely with its peers, raising security concerns. To make matters more intricate, the general practice of dedicating one microservice to a single container amplifies the networking challenge. This is because while some microservices need to communicate with each other, others shouldnâ€™t due to security reasons.

Some pressing threats include:

Internet exposure of orchestration tool management interfaces, even if these tools require login credentials.
Microservices accessing host services.
Microservices from the same application being unnecessarily exposed within the LAN/DMZ.
Traditional services like NFS, Samba, CI/CD tools, and databases becoming accessible targets.
Inadequate network separation between different tenants, causing them to share the same network.

Mitigation Techniques
Strict port management
Explicitly define and document the network ports that your containerized applications should expose and listen to. Regularly audit and ensure that only the necessary ports are exposed to mitigate potential access points.

Network isolation and segmentation
Create distinct networks for different types of workloads or services. For instance, a database should ideally not be on the same network as frontend services. When running multiple containerized applications or microservices, ensure they are in separate networks unless they genuinely need to communicate with one another.

Implement network policies
Even within a segmented network, use network policies to define precise communication rules between containers or services. By default, most orchestrators allow broad communication; tightening these rules reduces the risk of lateral movement in the event of a breach.

# Kubernetes
Kubernetes, when housing multiple microservices and tenants, presents concerns regarding the control of network traffic. By default, Kubernetes networking is flat, meaning any workload can interact with another. This allows attackers to exploit running workloads, probe internal networks, and traverse containers.

There are several approaches you can follow to enforce network isolation:

- **Multi-cluster isolation**: Utilize distinct clusters for different risk levels of tenants. This strategy can introduce complexity for closely integrated microservices but is valuable for risk-based segmentation.

- **Service mesh**: Tools like Istio, Linkerd, and Hashicorp Consul offer various methods to segment network traffic within a Kubernetes cluster.

- **CNI plugins**: The Container Network Interface (CNI) configures access to networking resources. Not all CNI plugins support network policies. When selecting a CNI plugin, please make sure it supports network policies if you plan to use them to control pod communications. Plugins like Calico and Cilium provide comprehensive network policy support, whereas others may not.

Additionally, Kubernetes provides a native solution, [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). These rules function akin to firewall regulations. They manage pod communication, ensuring pods only communicate with specified assets, barring all non-configured interactions.
