# CRAFT Method
C.R.A.F.T. prompting is a method used to create effective prompts for generative AI models. It focuses on four key elements to ensure that the AI produces the desired output. These elements are:

- Context: Provide background information or specific details to guide the AI's response.
- Role: Assign a specific role or persona to the AI, influencing its tone and style.
- Audience: Define the intended audience for the AI's output, helping it tailor the language and content.
- Format: Specify the desired format for the AI's output, such as a poem, code, or essay.
- Task: Clearly state the task you want the AI to perform, using action verbs like "write," "summarize," or "translate."

Vague prompt: "Write something about dogs."

> C.R.A.F.T. prompt: "You are a veterinarian. 
Write a short paragraph for new dog owners about the importance of regular checkups for their pets. 
The paragraph should be informative and easy to understand for people with no prior knowledge of veterinary medicine. 
Format the paragraph as a bullet point list."
