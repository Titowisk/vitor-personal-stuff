What are the things that a api project could implement?

# Must
- authentication/authorization
- api versioning if its consumed by mobile applications
- unit test: smallest piece of code that can be tested without dependencies (other apps or external dependencies)
    - mock everything
- logs

# Good
- documentation: postman, swagger...
- api versioning
- traces
- integration tests: pieces of logic that might include dependencies

# Great
- metrics
- possible http code responses

# Excellent
- performance tests
